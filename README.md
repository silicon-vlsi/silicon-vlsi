This repo mostly hosts courses and projects from the [Advanced VLSI Lab](https://silicon-vlsi.github.io) at [Silicon Institute of Technology](https://www.silicon.ac.in), Bhubaneswar.

# Trainings

## [LaunchLab Freshers Training](https://github.com/silicon-vlsi/LaunchLab-Freshers-Training)
This repository contains all the materials related to the basic MOSFET theory, CMOS technology, circuit and layout design, and basic PDK design. This is the material used for training all New College Graduates (NCG) with no or minimum knowledge in VLSI.

# Projects

## [Temperature Sensor (LM70) design cycle: Verilog-to-FPGA](https://github.com/silicon-vlsi/LM70-Interfacing-FPGA)
A system design project using Verilog and Xilinx FPGA development board. RTL to read a temperature sensor (LM70) using the SPI protocol. Synthesize and burn it into a Xilinx FPGA which is interfaced to a LM70 and the temperature is decoded and displayed on a 7-segment display.
